       " '         DIRECTOR OF BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT       Executive Profile    My goal is to use my unique collection of expertise,\\nexperience, and skills gained from my seventeen years as a construction\\nbusiness development and marketing representative, five years managing a sales\\nforce, six years helping my father run his historic home remodeling business, and\\nmy college education to reach my full potential as an account executive by\\nhelping Visio Financial Services achieve steady, long-term, sustainable growth\\nby building productive relationships with customers, co-workers, company\\nleadership, and other stakeholders.      Core Accomplishments       Sales and Marketing     Increased income 112% in 12 months in Austin  Increased market share from 20% to 70% in downtown Atlanta construction market in 12 months  Designed and executed branding plan to change the image of the organization, resulting in significant market share increase in each of 23 major U.S. cities  Investigated markets and target customer issues to create messaging strategy     Market Research     Defined industry segments and identified opportunities in 23 major U.S. cities  Discovered new opportunities in mature markets and developed and led the implementation of  plans to capture significant market share     Account Management     Managed various sized accounts and grew business by providing superb customer service  Successfully grew account sizes in 23 major U.S. markets  Trained local staff to continue the example of growing accounts through excellent client service        Professional Experience      Director of Business Development   04/2005   to   04/2015     Company Name   City  ,   State      Washington, DC I was called upon to develop and implement growth initiatives in the most difficult scenarios. Whether in low market share environments or during construction recessions or a combination of both, I significantly increased market share in any city to which I was assigned. Through my leadership and supervision, I expanded our market share in Miami, Knoxville, Minneapolis, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, Tulsa, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Orlando, Denver, Tucson, Houston, New Orleans, Biloxi, New York City, Indianapolis, Birmingham, Nashville, Chattanooga, Sacramento, Modesto, and Fresno.   Following is a partial list of noteworthy accomplishments from those assignments:     Miami  - I developed relationships with building owners in downtown Miami and leveraged those relationships into a group meeting of 17 building owners representing 38 buildings. I delivered a PowerPoint presentation which led to the owners to insist that their building managers give us priority budding status on every project. This one action resulted in substantial growth for my organization.    Minneapolis   - Redesigned the business development program to focus on building relationships with end-users. As a result, the end-users would insist on using us on their projects. Using this approach, I was able to build enough relationships in the construction industry to experience significant growth, even during a downturn in the construction market.     Austin   - I took over the business development program of a unit which had steadily declined its market share. After investigating untapped opportunities, I launched an initiative to pursue a new market. The careful execution of my plan resulted in more than a doubling of business in under 12 months. The relationships built with general contractors and end-users led to expanding our market share into San Antonio, Waco, and Dallas.     Denver   - When I arrived in Denver, out of a list of 200 clients, only 8 were attending monthly informational and sales meetings. I repositioned the agenda away from a \"pitchy, preachy\" sales presentation to an informational, educational, and interactive format. Within three months, attendance at those meetings grew from 8 to over 90 attendees.          Director of Business Development/Political Relations Director   01/1998   to   01/2005     Company Name    North Carlolina, South Carolina, Georgia After only three months as a field representative in Augusta, Georgia, I was promoted to Director of Business Development covering North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. Shortly afterwards, I was also named the political director for the three states. During my tenure, I focused primarily on growing market share in Atlanta and Charlotte, leveraging client, political, and end-user relationships to grow market share by 90% in the three states, with growth over 100% in Atlanta alone. Following is a partial list of highlights from those assignments: I attended and addressed shareholder meetings of public companies in Atlanta and built personal relationships with CEO\\'s and Directors from Suntrust Banks, Coca-Cola, Georgia Pacific, Genuine Parts (NAPA), Cousins Properties, Rollins (Orkin Pest Control), Equifax, Synovus Banks, and Georgia Power. Leveraged those relationships to secure work at projects for these companies and gained introductions to the executives of other end-users to provide even more bid opportunities. As Political Director, I endorsed and led labor and community groups to support the election of Shirley Franklin for Mayor of Atlanta, making Franklin the first female Mayor of Atlanta and the first African-American female mayor of any major city in the South. I also endorsed and served as labor liaison to Judge Denise Majette and used my contacts and influence to help her unseat Atlanta political powerhouse and multi-term United States Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney.è\\x81½ Additionally, I endorsed and assisted the successful campaigns of the first Hispanic elected to the Georgia State Senate and the first Hispanic elected to the Georgia House of Representatives.

Where are your thumbs? They are probably at about the midpoint\\\\nof the page. Most employers spend 15 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 30 seconds when first examining r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9, and\\\\nonly seeing the top half of your r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9. Therefore, everything above your thumbs\\\\nshould be the most important information that you want to convey to the employer, and\\\\neverything below your thumbs should support the message you are communicating.\\\\nIn this short amount of time employers determine your strengths and if you have\\\\nsomething to offer. If they feel that you do, they will look at your resume in more depth.\\\\nIf not, you will be filed away. You need to make sure that the employer knows what you\\\\nare capable of doing. If you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell them, no one else will. Employers want to\\\\nQUICKLY screen you out. Your goal is to get screened IN.\\\\nHow do you fashion your r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 so that it gets noticed? The employer doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have\\\\ntime to search your r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 for pertinent information \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 you must provide it on a silver\\\\nplatter \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 easy to obtain and elegantly presented.\\\\nTake the time to craft a r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 that is an accurate reflection of you. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do it alone!\\\\nTap into book and web resources, and ask others for input. Remember that you have\\\\nthe final say on your r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s appearance \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 you must like it. When you look at it, you\\\\nshould say, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWow, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m good!!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\n\\\\x0cWhat is a R\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 ?\\\\nIT IS NOT\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Your Autobiography\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Your Complete Obituary\\\\nIT IS\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 A Document Starting Your Professional Credentials\\\\nITS PURPOSE IS\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Not to Obtain a job\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 To Obtain an Interview (YOU get the job)\\\\n\\\\nYour R\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 Is Your Advertisement\\\\nIn most instances your r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 is your first contact with an employer. Make sure that it\\\\ngives a positive, professional impression. Your r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 is your advertising tool and\\\\nshould provide:\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 A sense of purpose - Why are you sending the r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9?\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Focus on achievements - What separates you from everyone else?\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Accuracy - Was it 2003 or 2004? Find out!!\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Clarity and Simplicity - This is not the time to try to use the word\\\\nantidisestablishmentarianism in a document.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 An attractive package - No jelly or coffee stains, please.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Salesmanship - What measurable facts can you provide?\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 A sense of person behind the resume -This flat piece of paper needs to sing\\\\nand dance so the employer will want to meet you in person.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Credibility - More than 80% of r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9s contain some stretch of the truth. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\ndo this. If you lose your professionalism, it will be nearly impossible to get it back.\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\n\\\\x0cWhy Do I Need a R\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 ?\\\\nEmployers are contacted by many applicants and have little time to thoroughly screen\\\\neach applicant. Employers want to know exactly how you can be useful to them without\\\\nhaving to read through excessive or unrelated details. A one page r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 is ideal for\\\\nthose with little experience: two pages are maximum for anyone.\\\\nA r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 should provide a positive impact by being clear, accurate, and relevant to the\\\\njob objective and focused on one industry or employer.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 YOU are the best person to write your r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 In most cases your r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 is your first contact with an employer.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Your r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 is a communication tool. Effective communication requires you to\\\\nbe responsible for conveying a clear message. If your reader doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get the\\\\ninformation, you didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t communicate successfully.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Your r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 summarizes who you are and what you can do.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Your r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 helps the employer decide whether or not to interview you.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Your r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 focuses on the employer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s needs, not yours.\\\\n\\\\nTHE 20 SECOND RULE\\\\nThe personnel directors of America\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s top corporations say again and again that if you\\\\nhaven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t presented the most important information about yourself in the top half of the\\\\nfirst page of your resume, you can probably forget about getting the job.\\\\nThe head of personnel management for one of the largest and most prestigious employers\\\\nin the Washington, D.C. area told the authors that she allows 20 seconds to scan each\\\\nresume she receives. If in that brief time, she does not see anything that gets her attention,\\\\nshe rejects the resume.\\\\nTaken from The 110 Biggest Mistakes Job Hunters Make by Richard L. Hermann and Linda P. Sutherland\\\\n\\\\nCarry r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9s with you when you are canvassing companies for job openings. Submit\\\\nthem with your application materials. When you send a r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 by mail or email,\\\\nalways include a cover letter to identify the job for which you are applying, and why the\\\\nemployer should hire you. Keep copies of your r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 in your car and have it available\\\\nat a moments notice.\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\n\\\\x0cR\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 Formats\\\\n\\\\nThere are two basic r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 formats that can be used to showcase your talents.\\\\nNeither one is better than the other and both are acceptable. Choose the format that\\\\nyou feel best showcases your abilities.\\\\n\\\\nCHRONOLOGICAL\\\\nThis format is good for people with extensive work experience either with one company\\\\nor a few companies, usually in the field in which they are seeking employment.\\\\nWork and educational experience is listed in reverse order of occurrence beginning with\\\\nthe most recent dates and working back.\\\\nJob duties are listed under the job title, organization and dates.\\\\n\\\\nCOMBINATION\\\\nThis format is good for career changers, those with gaps in employment and those who\\\\nwant to clearly sell specific skills, paralleling the needs of the employer. This format\\\\nallows a person to use skill clusters, while still listing dates, places of employment and\\\\njob responsibilities.\\\\nThis r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 format combines a chronological work experience with skill clusters. The\\\\nwork experience is organized in two separate sections:\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 A skill clusters section, which highlights major areas of accomplishments from\\\\nprevious employment, training and/or education programs. This allows you to\\\\norganize skills in an order that most supports your job objective.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 A chronological listing in reverse order containing job title, organization for which\\\\nyou worked, and dates of employment.\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\n\\\\x0cSample Chronological R\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9\\\\nJohn Doe\\\\n222 Market Street\\\\nLewisburg, PA 17837\\\\n570-524-0000\\\\nDoej@aol.com\\\\nOBJECTIVE\\\\n\\\\nTo obtain a position in corporate legal services with ABC Company\\\\n\\\\nEDUCATION\\\\n\\\\nBucknell University, Lewisburg, PA\\\\nBachelor of Arts\\\\nAnthropology\\\\nMay 2005\\\\n\\\\nRELATED EXPERIENCE\\\\nIntern\\\\n1/05-5/05\\\\nKomisarow, Baach & Snouffer, P.C.\\\\nMilton, PA\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2 Researched new healthcare law\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2 Balanced firm\\\\\\'s general ledger, handled press\\\\nreleases and various administrative responsibilities\\\\nTeaching Assistant, Introduction to Law\\\\n8/04-5/05\\\\nBucknell University\\\\nLewisburg, PA\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2 Evaluated 60 students on weekly papers\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2 Led class discussions one day per week\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2 Assisted professor with creating and evaluating exams\\\\nWORK EXPERIENCE\\\\nManager\\\\n11/01-5/03\\\\nLewisburg Freez\\\\nLewisburg, PA\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2 Trained, reviewed, and supervised 20 employees\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2 Evaluated and ordered $100,000 inventory\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2 Balanced four cash drawers and made nightly deposits\\\\nLANGUAGES\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2\\\\n\\\\nFluent in Spanish\\\\nMicrosoft Office, Macromedia Dreamweaver and Flash, Adobe\\\\nPhotoshop\\\\n\\\\nACTIVITIES\\\\nVolunteer, Sunsine Nursing Home\\\\nMember, Phi Theta Kappa\\\\n\\\\n6/02- present\\\\n8/03 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 present\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\n\\\\n\\\\x0cSample Chronological R\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9\\\\nJane Doe\\\\n1000 Anywhere Street\\\\nAnywhere, NY 10014\\\\n(212) 555-1212\\\\ndoej@hotmail.com\\\\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2\\\\n\\\\nDynamic, award-winning executive with over 12 years of proven success creating and\\\\nlaunching new products for domestic and international markets.\\\\nLed team of 55 to increase market share by 40%.\\\\nGranted patent for innovative communication tool used to acquire new clients.\\\\nSkilled in reducing marketing costs, managing cross-functional teams, and administering\\\\nmulti-billion dollar budgets.\\\\n\\\\nPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE\\\\nXYZ Corporation, New York, NY\\\\n2000-present\\\\nDivision Manager, Marketing Strategy and Development\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2 Direct strategic planning of Internet and high speed access services with $1.7 billion\\\\nannual revenue\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2 Create, track, and evaluate internal metrics and management reporting to identify\\\\nmarketing performance and effectiveness of programs, markets, and product mix.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2 Analyze industry trends and competitive landscapes.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2 Oversee opportunity identification and evaluation;

What one person\\\\nlikes, another may not. Ask for a lot of input before deciding on the r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 that is\\\\nright for you.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Keep it to one page unless you have significant experience in your field. If you do\\\\nhave a two page r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9, make sure they are two relatively complete pages.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 If you will be moving soon, use the two-address format.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Keep typeface simple. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s best to use Times-Roman or Arial.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 8 1/2\" x 11\" white or light colored, good quality paper is best. Avoid flashy \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9clook\\\\nat me\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d colors. Use matching paper for cover letter and avoid folding your r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9\\\\ninto a mailing envelope. Send it in a 9\" x 11\" mailing envelope.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Justify the left margin, but not the right. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s easier to read.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Highlight important information (your name, address, and titles of jobs, major\\\\ncategories) with boldface type.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Use 11 or 12-point type. Do not use graphics unless you are in the design field.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Save it on a computer disk. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s easier to update and/or change this way. Keep\\\\nthe disk safe, and make a back-up copy. Saving your r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 also lets you make\\\\ntargeted r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9s for specific positions to which you are applying.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Everything you put in your r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 is fair game for the interview. Be able to\\\\ndiscuss every point without having to refer to notes or ask for time to respond to\\\\na question.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Bring extra r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9s to your interview; even if you are sure your interviewer has a\\\\ncopy.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Use action words (see page 20) when describing what you have done. Examples\\\\ninclude: created, managed, developed, revised, presented, etc.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Proof. Proof. Proof. One mistake generally means you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re out the door. The\\\\nquality of your r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 reflects the quality of your work and professionalism. If\\\\nyou make a mistake on your r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9, will you make a mistake in your job?\\\\nEmployers will think so.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Remember the 3-Example Rule: If you list a skill, you need to come up with three\\\\nexamples to support it.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Highlight computer/technology knowledge and skills as well as experience\\\\n\\\\nworking as part of a group or team.\\\\n\\\\n11\\\\n\\\\n\\\\x0c12\\\\n\\\\n\\\\x0cParts of the R\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9\\\\nIdentification\\\\nThis section should include your name, address, telephone numbers (home, and/or cell\\\\nphone numbers), and e-mail address. Make sure the employer can reach you, or can\\\\nleave a message easily.\\\\n\\\\nTips\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Include area codes with all telephone numbers\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Make sure your voice mail message or e-mail address is not offensive,\\\\nunprofessional or \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ccutesy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x83 Examples of UNPROFESSIONAL emails:\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x83 Studmuffin@aol.com\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x83 emilyscarletohara@hotmail.com\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x83 sexychick@yahoo.com\\\\n\\\\nObjective\\\\nThe objective should tell what you can contribute and demonstrate the value you will\\\\nadd to the organization. The r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 material following the objective should support or\\\\nprove that you can perform the objective. If you have access to a computer, you can\\\\neasily change your job objective to suit each employment opportunity.\\\\nHaving an objective is OPTIONAL. If you choose not to use an objective, make sure\\\\nyou refer to the job you are targeting in your cover letter.\\\\n\\\\nSample Strong Objectives\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 A position as a General Sales Representative with Eli Lilly which will utilize my\\\\nchemistry and sales background.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 A position in data analysis where skills in mathematics, computer programming,\\\\nand deductive reasoning will contribute to new systems development.\\\\n\\\\nSample of Weak Objectives\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Management position which will use my business administration degree and will\\\\nprovide opportunities for rapid advancement and annual salary increases.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 A public relations position in which I can maximize opportunities to develop and\\\\nimplement programs, organize people and events, communicate positive ideas\\\\nand images.\\\\n\\\\n13\\\\n\\\\n\\\\x0cTips\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 The objective should be as short as possible, and not include such phrases as\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cchallenging position\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cutilizing my skills\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cgrowth potential\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9croom for\\\\nadvancement\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d, etc.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 If you are applying for a specific job opening, always use the employer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s job title\\\\nfor that position.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 If you choose not to use an objective, use a summary statement or qualifications\\\\nsection instead.\\\\n\\\\nShowcasing\\\\nThere are two sections of a r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 that are optional, but are excellent ways to\\\\nshowcase your abilities up front. Think of them as a quick snapshot of your best talents.\\\\nThis helps the employer get interested in you quickly!\\\\n\\\\nSummary Statement\\\\nWhen you have a number of years experience in a particular field or industry, this\\\\nstatement is often used as an alternative to an objective or as an addition. It portrays a\\\\nsummary of your credentials in sentence or paragraph form.\\\\n\\\\nExample\\\\nOver ten years of successful experience providing professional customer service.\\\\nProven ability to effectively handle difficult situations. Highly motivated, energetic and\\\\nvery creative.\\\\n\\\\nQualifications\\\\nThis section often appears on the r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 to highlight and summarize your areas of\\\\nexpertise, and your credentials, usually including 3 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 5 lines making reference to your\\\\nWork History, Education and Strengths or Self Management Skills.\\\\n\\\\nExamples\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Recently completed my BS degree in Mechanical Engineering\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Programming experience in Java, CTT and HTML\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Fluent in Spanish and Russian\\\\n\\\\nTips\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Put strong statements at the beginning of your r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9sum\\\\xc3\\\\xa9. The most important\\\\ninformation should come first.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t use the word \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d in any part of your resume.\\\\n\\\\n14\\\\n\\\\n\\\\x0cWorksheet: Showcase Your Accomplishments\\\\nShowcasing your abilities can a challenge, because most of us don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbrag\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d on a daily\\\\nbasis. However, to successfully communicate your skills to the employer, you need to\\\\nlearn how to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9csell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d yourself.\\\\nTake some time to list your accomplishments. Start now, but come back to it later,\\\\nwhen you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve thought of more things. Draw on all your experiences: paid, unpaid,\\\\nvolunteer, and home. Once you have a list you can pick and choose what you want to\\\\nhighlight.\\\\nThere is no right or wrong way to do this, but try to include as much information as\\\\npossible. If you trained people, how many? The employer doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know your\\\\ncapabilities, so your job is to educate him/her on what you can bring to the position!\\\\n\\\\nExamples\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Successfully managed $500,000 accounts receivables and reduced delinquent\\\\naccounts by 15 percent.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Trained over 100 staff members in CPR and First Aid procedures.\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\x99 Developed 35 new accounts while maintaining 60 existing accounts.\\\\n\\\\nAccomplishments\\\\n\\\\nKeep in mind the variety of experiences you have had which can transfer to other job\\\\nduties.

If you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t address the skills the\\\\nhiring manager is seeking, it is unlikely that you will be invited for an\\\\ninterview.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nLaramee finds the traditional practice of listing an objective to be unnecessary but does believe it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s important\\\\nthat credentials and contact information are at the top of the resume and\\\\neasy to spot. Because many jobs now\\\\nrequire applicants to apply online,\\\\nLaramee says it is key to make sure\\\\nyour e-mail address is accurate and is\\\\nhyperlinked, providing for easy use.\\\\nSome of the stronger resumes\\\\nLaramee has seen when recruiting for\\\\nmanagement positions have been\\\\nthose that have a bulleted summary\\\\nof skills at the top of a resume, for\\\\nexample, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn-depth comprehension of\\\\nprinciples of nutrition,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDemonstrated capability in customer service,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFlexibility to work alone or\\\\nas a team member\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d (see Figure 1).\\\\nBE SPECIFIC\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJob candidates should use strong\\\\nverbs like generate, implement, enhance, and improve,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d says Laramee.\\\\nIn addition to action verbs, specificity\\\\nin language is also necessary, especially when tailoring your resume as all\\\\nmid-career RD should do, say those interviewed for this article. Mary Jane\\\\nRogalski, MBA, RD, LDN, manager\\\\nof clinical nutrition at Baystate\\\\nMedical Center in Springfield, MA,\\\\nand the chair of the Clinical Nutrition Management dietetic practice\\\\ngroup, looks for details that paint a\\\\nclear picture of an RD\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s previous\\\\nemployment.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWords like, assessed patient needs\\\\nwon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do much to describe the type of\\\\npatient or the type of facility,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d says Rogalski. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn a clinical resume, I expect to\\\\nsee words that describe involvement\\\\nwith high nutrition risk patients, like\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\xa9 2010 by the American Dietetic Association\\\\n\\\\npercentage tube feeding or percentage\\\\ntotal parenteral nutrition. There needs\\\\nto be a heavier emphasis on diagnostic\\\\nskills\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d (see Figure 1). Clinicians in the\\\\ninpatient environment should specify\\\\nwhether they have worked in a trauma\\\\ncenter, teaching hospital, or community hospital as the level of patient nutrition acuity will vary by the type of\\\\ninstitution, says Rogalski. And clinicians in the outpatient environment\\\\nwould be wise to include specific counseling skills, such as motivational interviewing, when working with clients\\\\noutside the hospital environment.\\\\nOf course, specificity is not limited to\\\\nclinical dietitians\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 resumes. Public health\\\\nand community dietitians would want\\\\nto provide specific demographics about\\\\nthe communities they have served\\\\nin the past along with measurable\\\\nachievements in those communities. A\\\\npublic health nutritionist would also\\\\nwant to include his or her knowledge\\\\nand experience with population-based\\\\nnutrition interventions, community organizing and mobilizing, breastfeeding\\\\neducation and promotion, and familiarity with government-sponsored programs such as WIC (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,\\\\nInfants, and Children). An RD working\\\\nin a school environment would need to\\\\nlist experience and familiarity with federal and state nutrition standards such\\\\nas those set by the National School\\\\nLunch Program. School-based dietitians would also need to address potential responsibilities including participating in quality initiatives and\\\\ngathering and analyzing data to evaluate and improve outcomes, developing\\\\nand coordinating the efforts of the foodservice staff in order to promote nutrition and healthy eating, and analyzing\\\\nmenus and recipes for nutritional adequacy. An RD working with information technology and developing health\\\\ntechnologies would want to showcase\\\\nhis or her experience working with\\\\ndata management systems or knowledge of laws and regulations protecting\\\\nhealth data security and privacy (Figure 2).\\\\n\\\\nJournal of the AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION\\\\n\\\\n353\\\\n\\\\n\\\\x0cBUSINESS OF DIETETICS\\\\n\\\\nJoan Smith, MPH, RD, CSR, LDN, CDE\\\\n321 South Street, Someplace, PA 43210\\\\nH: (098) 765-4321 C: (123) 346-7890\\\\njoansmith@net.net\\\\nSkills Summary\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Critical thinking to integrate facts, informed opinions, active listening, and observations.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Decision making, problem solving, and collaboration.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Medical nutrition therapy counseling for individuals in adult and pediatric diabetes.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Instructor for classes on diabetes self management for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Strong interpersonal skills to establish productive working relationships with multidisciplinary team and support services.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Communicate effectively in both written and verbal form to patients, public, medical staff, and physicians.\\\\nProfessional Experience\\\\n11/2005 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 Present\\\\nClinical Dietitian/Diabetes Educator\\\\nMedical Center, Somewhere, PA\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Conduct nutrition assessment when warranted by a patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s needs or conditions.

A corporate dietitian may want to specify media\\\\nevents in which he or she served as a\\\\ncorporate spokesperson; a history of\\\\nattending trade shows, conferences,\\\\nand professional meetings; and brochures, Web sites, and promotional\\\\nmaterials he or she helped create. A\\\\nfood and nutrition policy consultant\\\\nwould most likely want to include\\\\nyears of experience educating and lobbying members of Congress on nutrition topics, familiarity with legislation and regulation that impact the\\\\nnutrition industry, and experience\\\\nconsulting with clients to develop targeted messages and responses to policies and regulations. A culinary nutrition consultant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94whose primary\\\\nresponsibilities might include writing\\\\nand editing cookbooks, public speaking,\\\\nand offering personal chef services\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nwould want to provide a publishing and\\\\n\\\\n358\\\\n\\\\nMarch 2010 Volume 110 Number 3\\\\n\\\\nediting history, locations and class\\\\nsizes of nutrition-based cooking classes\\\\nand food demonstrations, and an understanding of Joint Commission and\\\\nfood safety standards.\\\\nLaramee also suggests that for midcareer RDs, each previous place of employment include fewer bullets of information, and RDs with many years of\\\\nexperience can probably omit entry-level\\\\npositions or simply list them without providing additional details. While many\\\\nRDs with lengthy careers need more\\\\nthan one page, a resume should never be\\\\nmore than two pages, Laramee advises.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe resume itself shows your skills\\\\nand qualifications in the way it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s organized and displayed,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she says. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you\\\\nput too much irrelevant information in\\\\nyour resume, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re showing that you\\\\nlack focus or have difficulty with decisions, and your resume will lack clarity.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nINCLUDE RELEVANT INFORMATION\\\\nAs for education and work history,\\\\nLaramee advises that RDs include only\\\\nrelevant material. Information about a\\\\nhigh school diploma and courses taken\\\\nin college are generally irrelevant. Be\\\\n\\\\nprepared to briefly and clearly explain\\\\nany gaps in work history, and if rereentering the workforce after time off\\\\nfor family issues, be prepared to discuss\\\\nhow you have maintained your skills\\\\nand kept up to date with new information during that gap.\\\\nRDs with extensive careers may\\\\nwant to skip dates that reveal age,\\\\nsuch as the year a bachelor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s degree\\\\nwas earned, says Laramee. Simply\\\\nlisting the university and degree obtained is sufficient.\\\\nWhile certifications, registrations,\\\\nprofessional involvement, and awards\\\\nspecific to the field are all important\\\\nto include, outside activities or positions outside of dietetics should not\\\\nbe included unless they can somehow be tailored to fit the position\\\\napplied for.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI had one applicant who included\\\\ninformation on her first career as a florist because she was able to discuss the\\\\ncustomer service skills she had as a\\\\nsmall business owner,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d says Rogalski.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThose skills could be connected to the\\\\npatient service skills she was going to\\\\nhave to take on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\x0cBUSINESS OF DIETETICS\\\\nNAME\\\\n\\\\nMary Doe, PhD, RD\\\\n\\\\nDEPARTMENT\\\\n\\\\nMedical Affairs\\\\n\\\\nLOCATION\\\\n\\\\nBoston, MA, USA\\\\n\\\\nEDUCATION\\\\n2004\\\\n\\\\nPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE\\\\n2007 to Present\\\\n\\\\nPhD, Nutritional Biochemistry and Human Metabolism\\\\nTufts University Freidman School of Nutrition Science and Policy\\\\nBoston, MA, USA\\\\nDirector, Endocrinology, Metabolic Disease and Cardiology\\\\nAcme Research Company\\\\n\\\\nPerform literature searches, write case studies, internal and external education, and support all efforts at bid defense meetings\\\\nHeavy involvement with operations groups as well as other business segments\\\\nManage nutrition operations in the endocrinology and cardiology therapeutic area for this fast growing, medically focused and state of the art\\\\nglobal CRO\\\\nResponsible for medical/clinical components of the following product/service areas: clinical research and data analysis, study feasibility, study\\\\ndesign and protocol development, reporting and publishing, consulting, and overall service delivery\\\\nServe as lead dietitian and nutritionist for the endocrinology and cardiology therapeutic business unit, and act as major \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cout front\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d person for the\\\\nenterprise\\\\nLICENSURE/CERTIFICATION\\\\n2001 to Present\\\\n\\\\nPROFESSIONAL MEMBERSHIPS\\\\n2000-2007\\\\n\\\\nEDITORIAL BOARDS\\\\n2004 to Present\\\\n\\\\nLicensed Dietitian/Nutritionist\\\\nBoard of Dietitians and Nutritionist\\\\nDivision of Professional Licensure\\\\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts\\\\nBoston, MA, USA\\\\nEx-officio Member, General Clinical Research Center\\\\nScientific Advisory Committee\\\\nBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center\\\\nAd hoc reviewer, Obesity Research\\\\n\\\\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\\\\n1.

Sample curriculum vitae for a research dietitian. (Note: Most curriculum vitas are two to three pages in length depending on experience.\\\\nThis sample has omitted some details for length.)\\\\n\\\\nMarch 2010 \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Journal of the AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION\\\\n\\\\n359\\\\n\\\\n\\\\x0cBUSINESS OF DIETETICS\\\\nTHE CV\\\\nAccording to Jeanene Fogli, PhD, RD,\\\\nchair of the Research dietetic practice\\\\ngroup, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s important to note that the\\\\nresearch and education field may require a different type of resume\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a curriculum vitae (known as a CV)\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94when\\\\napplying for jobs. Whether applying to\\\\nacademic positions or for-profit research positions (such as working for a\\\\npharmaceutical company), interested\\\\napplicants will most likely create a CV.\\\\nFogli, a director of medical and scientific affairs for i3 Research (Basking\\\\nRidge, NJ), says a CV will include educational and professional experience,\\\\nbut unlike a resume will also include a\\\\npublishing history and a list of editorial\\\\nboards the applicant is a member of\\\\n(see Figure 5 for a sample CV).\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA publication history is key,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d says\\\\nFogli. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you are applying to a for-profit\\\\ncompany, they want to sell your expertise, and a publishing history is part of\\\\nthat.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Fogli adds that all applicants for\\\\nresearch positions should include details on any exposure to clinical research and highlight any additional\\\\ncoursework in the sciences. A strong\\\\nresearch dietitian\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s CV will also specify\\\\nexperience with regulatory filings for\\\\nagencies like the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency as well as familiarity with\\\\ncommonly used standardized research\\\\nmeasures such as the National Heart,\\\\nLung, and Blood Institute\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s iliac waist\\\\nmeasurement. Fogli adds that potential employers are looking for future\\\\nemployees who will not need to be\\\\ntrained in specific differences between\\\\na phase I and phase III trial and who\\\\nwill not need to be educated in the use\\\\nof common measurements.\\\\nApplicants should also include any\\\\nfunding they have received, such as\\\\nlisting a percentage of salary support\\\\nfor a particular study and identifying\\\\nthe funder. (For example, a CV may\\\\nstate 40% salary support for a study on\\\\nthe effect of jelly beans on the diet with\\\\nfunding coming from The National\\\\nJelly Bean Board.) According to Fogli,\\\\nthere is not one set standard for where\\\\nin the CV this information should be\\\\nincluded although it should appear\\\\nprominently.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are expected to bring in research dollars,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d says Fogli. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you\\\\nhave a history of doing that, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a\\\\nbonus, so include it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n360\\\\n\\\\nMarch 2010 Volume 110 Number 3\\\\n\\\\nONLINE RESUMES\\\\nMany of the popular job and professional networking sites, such as Monster, Hot Jobs, or LinkedIn, as well as\\\\nother niche Web sites or services like\\\\nADACareerLink, have you create a\\\\nprofile where you can upload a resume,\\\\nor several, or have you create a resume\\\\nusing their resume form. Some job sites\\\\nlet you apply for positions by simply\\\\nsubmitting your profile information. In\\\\nthese instances, you should edit your\\\\nprofile so that it specifically reflects the\\\\njob for which you are posting. However,\\\\nmost job sites either provide contact information with an e-mail address\\\\nwhere you should send your resume or\\\\nprovide a link directly to the employers\\\\nWeb site where contact information is\\\\nprovided or you have to fill out an online form.\\\\nIn these cases, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a good idea to create your resume in several formats: a\\\\nprint version, a scannable version, and\\\\na plain text version. A print version can\\\\ncontain italicized or underlined text,\\\\ndifferent fonts and sizes, bulleted lists,\\\\nand other design elements. This copy\\\\nshould be used hand to contacts and\\\\ninterviewers or sent via mail. A scannable version, to send as an e-mail attachment or upload as a file to a Web\\\\nsite, should contain limited design elements as it is first viewed by a computer and then uploaded to a database\\\\nwhere employers can search resumes\\\\nbased on keywords. Design elements\\\\nand text formatting can interfere with\\\\nthe scan. For scannable resumes, use\\\\none common font (such as Times New\\\\nRoman) throughout (1). Instead of increasing the size of the font, use spacing to break up sections (1). Also, avoid\\\\nusing bullets, tables, and visuals in a\\\\nscannable resume; instead, use dashes,\\\\nleft-justified text, and simple spacing\\\\n(1). A plain text version, or text-only\\\\ncopy, is a version you should have\\\\navailable to cut and paste into online\\\\nforms or the body of an email. As the\\\\nname implies a plain text version contains no design elements.\\\\nWhichever format is used, you\\\\nwant to create a resume specifically\\\\nfor the job you are applying for.\\\\nAlso, remember to update all the\\\\nversions of your resume; otherwise,\\\\nyou may update your print version and\\\\naccidently send out a scannable version\\\\nthat wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t updated.\\\\n\\\\nADAPT\\\\nFogli adds that positions that include\\\\npresenting to clients\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94research or otherwise\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94may require the applicant to\\\\nsupply a video of such a presentation,\\\\nso the hiring company can see performance in action.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne of the biggest mistakes applicants make is not finding out more\\\\nabout the position and its requirements\\\\nbeforehand and not tailoring their resume to the job,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d says Laramee.\\\\nWhether an RD\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s interest is clinical,\\\\npublic health, research, or another area\\\\nin dietetics, experts\",\n",
